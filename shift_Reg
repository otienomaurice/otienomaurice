//Description:The following is a system verilog module for a 
//simple serial to parallell and parallel to serial converter
//There is a synchronous reset that resets the circuit back to zero
//The load input determines whether to shift to parallel or to serial transmission
//When load is asserted, the shift register loads in the D inputs 
//Otherwise, the circuit loads in the S_in input and shifts it throught he q outputs every clock edge
//IN PARALLEL MODE, THE OUTPUT SCALARS ARE CONVERTED INTO A SINGLE FOUR-BIT VECTOR
